# WordIndex CW1

A simple program that counts the words in different files and adds them to a hash table or a linled list map to see the difference in speed for each implementation.
You can either add all the words from a file, search for a word, add words from multiple files, remove a file that was already added and have an overview of the words added which includes the number of positions and files.
